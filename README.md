This script was developed to extract and analyze data from some ZkTeco biometric check-in devices and solve the issues with their poor software.

These specific devices can generate a file of all registered workers (.csv) and another file with time logs (.dat), but their software does not allow exporting them into a useful format or make accurate analysis.

This was very useful for HR in the company I used to work as a helpdesk assistant.

I remember "compiling" and deploying this script with executables for Windows and MacOS generated with tools like [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller)

Basically, this script works like this:

  - Takes the two files generated by the device**
  - Assigns all the check-ins and check-outs with their respective worker
  - Sorts all the records by worker id and date
  - Filters all the records where the time difference between them is less than 15 minutes (keeping the most recent one)
  - Generates a .csv file with the filtered records and generates another one with all the records

** To obtain the mentioned files from the device, they need to be extracted from the device using a FAT32 formatted USB drive. 

** The test files in this repository were taken directly from the device without any modifications except for the worker names, which were changed for privacy reasons.
